# Fake-news-detection-RNN-LSTM-GRU-and-Bi-LSTM
A deep learning project for fake news detection in Dravidian language (Malayalam) text. This notebook systematically compares four recurrent neural network architectures: Simple RNN, LSTM, GRU, and Bidirectional LSTM. Built with TensorFlow/Keras, it finds that Bi-LSTM achieves the highest classification accuracy.
